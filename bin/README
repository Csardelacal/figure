# Figure
Figure intends to provide a consistent and strong backend for applications to maintain user uploaded
images with ease. Whenever a user uploads a file, figure can directly receive it, generating a secret
that the application generating the request to upload the file can exchange for ownership of the 
file.

## Installing / Getting started

You can start figure with `docker-compose` like

```shell
docker build .
docker-compose up -d
```

The `d` stands for daemon and keeps docker running in the background, so Figure will continue
running even if you close the terminal. It's optional.

If you want the project to run without `docker` I recommend you still check into the `Dockerfile`
since that contains the detailed instructions on how we exactly set up our environment. But you'll
need [composer](https://getcomposer.com) to pull the dependencies for the project.

```shell
apt install php-mysql php-memcached memcached php-intl
composer install
nano bin/settings/environments.php # To edit the database credentials
```


## Developing

To help the development of figure, please start of by reaching out to us. We do
only mirror our code to Github, but internally use Phabricator for code reviews and
similar. This means that accepting Pull Requests is cumbersome for us and will
remove credit from you. Just shoot us an email at cesar@magic3w.com and I'll help
you get started with Phabricator.

Once you have an account on our Phabricator and have `Arcanist` set up, you can just 
pull the repository like normal:

```shell
git clone ssh://git@phabricator.magic3w.com/source/figure.git
cd figure/
composer install
```

To start working on your own changes I recommend you check out a new branch on your
local repository.

```shell
git checkout -b dev/my-new-feature
```

You can now make the changes you need. Test the code locally, once you're satisfied,
you can send us a `diff` (Phabricator's version of a Pull Request) by following these
steps.

```shell
composer test # This will tell you if your code matches our guidelines.
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
arc diff
```

You will be prompted to explain the changes you made, how to test them and who should
review your change. You can leave the reviewer empty if you're unsure.

### Building

Once you've made your changes and wish to test the application, just run:

```shell
docker build .
```

You should get a built container out of this that you can now publish to your
server or push to a docker registry from which it can be downloaded. If you're
running on a Kubernetes cluster, you can also push it to the cluster directly.

## Features

* Receive file uploads and store them to an object storage of your liking
* [TBA] Cache files so the server can 'mirror' stored data
* Allow applications to claim files


## Contributing

Thank you so much for contributing to making the project better. We appreciate
all contributions, big and small.

Code submissions are always welcome. As stated above, I would recommend you reach
out and get onboarded to our Phabricator, but if you just want to make a small
submission you can always send a pull request on Github.

## What is the /bin folder?

Historically, applications would place compiled versions of their applications in
a bin folder, which stands for binary. Obviously, PHP does not generate binaries.

Instead, Spitfire uses the bin folder to place components of your application that
are built in a development environment and even, in some cases, committed to the 
repository.

The bin folder is private, it contains no resources, and it is not advisable to
scan it for usable classes or similar. It contains a single bootstrap script that
includes a series of files that are necessary for the application to work.
